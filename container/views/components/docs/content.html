<hr>
<p>an <strong>RESTApi</strong> boilerplate, or template for <strong>node.js</strong>,  best starting point for dev’s who already have the knowledge on how MVC framework works,<br>
in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database</li>
<li>Model</li>
<li>Controller</li>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Middlewares</li>
<li>Bindings</li>
</ul>
<p>It is basically just like mvc frameworks,<br>
but right as of this moment, please slash out the [view] part. as this template only supports <strong>Rest</strong>,</p>
<p><em>hopeful that i can add that soon.</em></p>
<p>it might still be missing some features, please take a note on that, and if you’re interested, we can open a discussion about that.<br>
i’ll release some API docs, please checkout: <a href="https://castmonkeys.com/">https://castmonkeys.com/</a><br>
*and find the community for chasi, as i’ll be posting any upcommings in that website,<br>
and plus you can also add some discussions if you have any suggestions.</p>
